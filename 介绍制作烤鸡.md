Ingredients

3 pounds chicken

1½ tablespoons seasoning

3 tablespoons cooking wine

6 cloves of garlic

A few tablespoons canola oil

A few lemon pieces

Preparation

Put the chicken in a large bowl, pour cooking wine to the chicken. Put it in the fridge for about half an hour, then season the bird. Ensures that the seasoning is distributed throughout the meat. 
This method results in meat with seasoning in it rather than on it. Add 6 cloves of garlic and a few lemon pieces inside the chicken. Put the seasoned chicken in the fridge for at least 3 hours before cooking. 
About half an hour before roasting the chicken, turn the oven to 460°F and let it heat up. You want it plenty hot in there. Meanwhile, take the chicken from the fridge and dry it with paper towels. Set aside.

Cooking

Oil a large heavy-bottomed skillet; cast iron is one of the good choices. You want a thick coating of oil that is more than a slick, less than a puddle. Place the pan over a high heat on the stovetop. 
After heating the oil, gently—really gently, so the oil doesn’t splatter and burn you—put the chicken in the pan skin side down and cook. After about 3 minutes its skin will turn faintly blond. Transfer the skillet to the floor of the oven. 
Depending on the size of the bird, the total cooking time in the oven will range from 19 minutes to half an hour. The chicken is done when the temperature in the thickest part registers 160°F on a thermometer. 
When the chicken is done, cut it into pieces, put them on a platter, and serve as is, or with a squeeze of lemon.
