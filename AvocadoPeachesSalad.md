    This salad is made with minimal effort. It could be served as a side dish during breakfast or lunch.



Ingredients

    3 tablespoons red wine vinegar

    1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped

    1/2 teaspoon sugar

    1/3 cup olive oil

    3 almost-ripe avocados

    9 cups sorrel

    3 peaches, diced and peeled

 

Preparation

    Roast bell pepper. Peel and chop pepper; puree with red wine vinegar, vanilla, and sugar in a blender.

    With the machine running, gradually add olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.

    Halve avocados, season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and place cut side down on a medium-hot grill for about 5 minutes. Peel and thickly slice.

    Toss with sorrel and peaches. Drizzle dressing over.
