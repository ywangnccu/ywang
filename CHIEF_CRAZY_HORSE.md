Crazy Horse was the chief of the Sioux Nation, a Native American in North America. He fought alongside shaman Sitting Bull. 
The most famous battle that he participated in was the Battle of Little Big Horn, fought to protect sacred sites on American soil. 
They led thousands of indigenous people in the Black Hills Valley with a superior force, obliterated hundreds of cavalrymen of the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division and killed the regiment's commander, Kasdar.  
Victory was made. Chief Crazy Horse was known for his bravery and valor.

Unfortunately, Chief Crazy Horse found himself up against another hurdle—feeding the starving Sioux. Lieutenant Philo Clark negotiated with Crazy Horse, 
offering him and the Sioux a reservation to live on as long as they agreed to surrender. Soon after, Crazy Horse was arrested for not abiding by Clark’s negotiation. Moreover, 
while being held captive in Fort Robinson, Nebraska, Crazy Horse attempted to stab a man named Little Big Man. During the struggle, an unnamed shoved a bayonet into Crazy Horse’s abdomen, piercing his kidneys.

Did you know deep in the Black Hills of South Dakota has a monument called the Crazy Horse Memorial? If you were to see this monumental carving in person, 
it depicts the face of a Native American man, carved out of the Thunderhead Mountain in the Black Hills. The hills are sacred land and property of the Lakota tribes who inhabit them. 
The memorial honors Crazy Horse, a legendary Lakota leader from the 1800s.

The Crazy Horse Memorial is the world’s largest sculpture and monument. Once completed the memorial will stand 563 feet high and be 641 feet long. 
This means the monument will be 6,532 feet above sea level. Thus, making it bigger than Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty.

Although the memorial has a long journey ahead of completion, visitors are exposed to the awareness of who Crazy Horse was and the Lakota tribes who lived there. 
The carving of Crazy Horse charging into battle is a reminder of how he and his people persevered from colonialism. Their spirit lives on through the memorial.
