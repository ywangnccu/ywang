HOW TO COOK SIRLOIN STEAK

Now you might be wondering how to cook it. When cooking sirloin, 
the easiest way to tell if it’s done or not is to take a look at the inside of the steak with a thermometer. 
You can buy meat thermometers at your local supermarket.

If you cook meat often, or if you’re new to cooking meat,
having a thermometer is a great way to make sure if the meat is done and will ensure you don’t overcook or burn the meat.

Here are the minimum temperatures your meat needs to reach before you pull it off the grill. 
Remember that sirloin will continue to cook after you take it off the heat, 
so taking a look at the inside’s color is not always the best way to tell if the meat is done or not. Always use a thermometer to measure.
