Take a moment to read the history and story of Checkli. 

As long as I can remember I've felt overwhelmed with enormous amounts of energy. 
There was always so much to do and so much to think about. I couldn't relax and I couldn't focus.
During my college years the worrying turned into anxiety. 
After graduating I channeled my endless energy into becoming an entrepreneur and found myself suffering from even more anxiety.

I was prescribed Ritalin and Adderall, but I wouldn't take them.

There had to be a better way.

One day, I made a simple checklist to organize the chaos in my mind and for the first time I felt relaxed, organized and focused. 
So, I started making more checklists. The more checklists I made, the less anxiety I felt.

Think of checklists as a plugin for the mind. They help us remember and organize the endless list of things we have to do and want to do.

I founded Checkli so I could share my story of checklists with the world.

Marvin,
Founder of Checkli
