The world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.

There are some things that time cannot mend. 

In this hour, I do not believe that any darkness will endure.

It is useless to meet revenge with revenge; it will heal nothing.

It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish.

No Victory without Suffering.

Where there's life there's hope.

Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.

False hopes are more dangerous than fears.
