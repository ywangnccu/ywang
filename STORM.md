The storm is any disturbed state of the natural atmosphere. It usually has significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, tornadoes, hurricanes, hail, thunderstorm, 
heavy precipitation, heavy ice storm, tropical cyclone, windstorm, wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as in a dust storm, among other forms of severe weather.

Storms have the potential to harm lives and property via storm surge, heavy rain or snow causing flooding or road impassibility, lightning, wildfires, and vertical and horizontal wind shear.

Storms are created when a center of low pressure develops with the system of high pressure surrounding it. This combination of opposing forces can create winds and result in the formation of cumulonimbus. 
Small localized areas of low pressure can form from hot air rising off hot ground, resulting in smaller disturbances such as dust devils and whirlwinds.

There are about 16 million thunderstorms each year in our world. That is according to the National Severe Storms Laboratory.

 

What should you do during a storm?


People are advised to stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed.

This is particularly important in areas where gales of up to 160km/h are possible. It means flying debris could cause danger to life.

If you do have to go out, you should avoid walking next to buildings, trees and the sheltered side of walls or fences, in case of collapse.

You should not attempt to repair any damage to your property or possessions while a storm is in progress.

Listen out for weather forecasts on local radio and TV, and read government websites for the latest updates.

Please bring animals inside and ensure you have sufficient food and fresh water.

If you can smell gas and suspect there is a leak, you can report it by calling the police.

If you lose electricity you should turn off every non-essential appliance. However, you should leave a light on so you know when the supply returns.

You can report a power cut online or by calling your local electronic energy company.

 

Can you drive during a storm?


Do not drive unless your journey is unavoidable, and avoid clear of flooded or exposed routes such as bridges.

If you have to drive, make sure you have essential supplies such as clothing, food, drink, blankets and a torch, and carry a fully-charged phone.

Drive slowly, and be especially cautious around high-sided vehicles and when overtaking. Give other vehicles extra room.

Driving during a storm does not automatically invalidate your car insurance. However, it may make a claim more difficult.

An insurer might try to prove negligence, such as driving on a road when advised not to, and refuse the claim.

 

What can you do to protect your property?


Securing loose objects outside a property such as bins, ladders, trampolines and outdoor games, garden furniture and tools.

Making sure you know how to turn off the gas, electricity and water in case you have to leave the building.

Clearing guttering of debris.

Closing and fastening external doors. Closing and securing loft trapdoors.

Securing storm shutters.

Parking vehicles in a garage, if you have one; otherwise ensuring they are as far away as possible from buildings, trees and fences.

If you are in a flood-risk area, try to move valuable or essential items upstairs or put them as high as you can on the ground floor. You should go to the highest level of the building you are in.

Making sure fences and roof tiles are secure.

Charging mobile phones and any other critical devices including battery packs.



What should you do after a storm?


Not do anything that puts you or your building at risk.

A common misconception is that building owners are responsible for the fences on the left of their property. 
Actually, there is no general rule about who owns the fence so building owners should read their title deeds to see the boundaries they own.


Unless they are dangerous, don't throw away damaged items without talking it with your insurer, in case they can be repaired.

Please be especially careful around any exposed electrical or telephone cables.

Remember it can take weeks or even months for a property to fully dry out after storm damage, so you may need to wait some time before redecorating.

If necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any more damages. Tell your insurer and keep receipts, as this will form part of your claim.

Only return to your building after a storm when it is safe to do so.

Most buildings, contents and commercial business insurance cover storm damage.

Contact your insurance company as soon as possible if you have suffered damage to your property or possessions. Most insurance companies have emergency helplines that can advise on next steps and arrange repairs.
