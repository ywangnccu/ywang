Maple syrup — it’s not just for breakfast anymore. The following Mini Maple-Lemon Glazed Ham recipe is good for lunch or picnic.

INGREDIENTS

1 cup maple syrup

Half cup lemon juice

1 Tablespoon Cooking Oil

1 Tablespoon thyme

Half package petite ham half (about 1 lb.)

Black pepper

 
INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat the oven to 425°. Coat a rack inside a shallow roasting pan with nonstick spray.

Combine maple syrup, lemon juice, and oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. 
Reduce heat to medium and simmer syrup mixture for 6 minutes; stir in thyme.

Reserve half the syrup mixture for basting and half for serving.

Arrange ham on a prepared rack; cover tightly with foil and cook for 20 minutes. 
Uncover ham and cook, basting every 9 minutes, a thermometer inserted in the ham registers 140°, 30 minutes more; cover loosely with foil if cooked quickly.


Transfer ham to a cutting board; tent with foil and let rest a few minutes before carving. Serve ham with the remaining half of the syrup mixture.
