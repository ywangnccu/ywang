The Junkers 90 V6 airframe was used in the construction of the Junkers 390 V1. The Junkers 390 intended to fly as a heavy transport aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft and long-range bomber. 

The Junkers 390 V1 was constructed and largely assembled at Junkers' plant at Dessau in Germany and the first test flight took place in 1943. 
The Junkers 390 V1 with many other new aircraft and prototypes was shown to Adolf Hitler at Insterburg. According to the logbook of a former Junkers test pilot, 
the Junkers 390 V1 was brought to Prague immediately after it had been displayed at Insterburg. It still took part in a number of test flights, including tests of aerial refueling. 
One year later, the Junkers 390 V1 was returned to Dessau, where it was stripped of parts. Finally it was scraped and destroyed as the US Army approached.
