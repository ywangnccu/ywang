We’ve already pretty much established that the most important skincare step you should never skip is applying sunscreen. 
Prevention is always better than cure and there’s no other skincare product that can prevent a myriad of skin problems other than sunscreen. 
However, despite this fact, we found that a lot of people choose to skip this crucial step.

There are various reasons why people end up setting aside their sunscreens. However, one of the most notable reasons is that people do not enjoy looking oily. 
This is especially true for those who already have an oily skin type.

So, we totally get it! However, this should not be the case with the best sunscreen and proper application. Here are some tips on how to wear SPF.


Tips on how to use sunscreen

Look for oil-free mineral sunscreens

The first and most important step is to find the right sunscreen. Not every sunscreen is created equally. 
Look for the best oil-free mineral sunscreen for your skin type, preferably those that contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. 
While mineral sunscreens only protect from UVA and UVB rays, they’re less likely to be oily than physical sunscreens.
 

Prep your face before applying sunscreen

Another crucial step to avoid is to prepare your skin properly to remove oil build-up. Clean your face with a cleanser and apply some toner. 
Toners are great for wiping off excess oil. You may also blot the oil from your face, especially in the oilier areas like the T-zone.

Having a clean and oil-free canvas reduces the chance of oiling up so make sure to prep your skin properly prior to sunscreen application.


Apply sunscreen properly

The amount of sunscreen you apply is also vital. Add a small droplet of SPF to your forehead, cheeks, and chin, and massage it over your face. Keep doing so the skin absorbs the product.

If you feel like your skin is oily even after full absorption, lightly blot the excess oil with a blotting film or cotton ball.

 
Powder up

Unless you’re planning to jump into that pool, add a little powder over your sunscreen to matte your face. Focus on areas where you’re usually the oiliest. 
Make sure though that you do not overdo this step—only apply a thin layer if you don’t want your skin looking cakey. Moderation is key!

Don’t solely rely on make-ups with built-in SPF

While tinted foundations and creams with SPF are a lot more convenient, they were found to be less effective in protecting your skin compared to stand-alone sunscreens. 
Lathering on a good layer of sunscreen is far more beneficial for you.

However, this doesn’t mean you should skip on your favorite tinted foundation with SPF. 
You can very much enjoy your favorite make-up base as long as you make sure to apply sunscreen under it.


Conclusion

The summer is the time when you have to stick with your sunscreen the most. Hoping the tips above help you reap the benefits of applying sunscreen without looking oily. 
Remember, skipping sunscreen is never an option.
