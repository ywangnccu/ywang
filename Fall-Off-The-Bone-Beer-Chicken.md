Ingredients

    3 tablespoons garlic powder

    Half bottle beer - 6 ounce

    1 whole rooster chicken, giblets discarded

    Half cup oil

    3 cloves garlic, smashed

    3 tablespoons sugar

    1 tablespoon paprika

    1 tablespoon ground pepper

    1 tablespoon light soy sauce

    3 tablespoons onion powder


Directions

    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

    Spoon garlic powder into beer. Prop the rooster, put beer into the rooster.

    Pour oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook for about 2 minutes. Remove garlic and discard.

    Inject rooster with the garlic-infused oil using a baster or injector.

    Mix sugar, paprika, pepper, and soy sauce in a small bowl. Coat chicken with sugar mixture.

    Bake in the preheated oven for about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F.
