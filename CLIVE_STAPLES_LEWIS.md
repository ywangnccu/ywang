God can't give us peace and happiness apart from Himself because there is no such thing.

When we lose one blessing, another is often most unexpectedly given in its place.

Things never happen the same way twice.

We were promised sufferings. They were part of the program. We were even told, 'Blessed are they that mourn,' and I accept it. I've got nothing that I hadn't bargained for. 
Of course it is different when the thing happens to oneself, not to others, and in reality, not imagination.

If a man thinks he is not conceited, he is very conceited indeed.

Do not let us mistake necessary evils for good.

The more we let God take us over, the more truly ourselves we become - because He made us. He invented us.

We meet no ordinary people in our lives.

As long as you are proud you cannot know God. Proud man is always looking down on things and people; and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you.
