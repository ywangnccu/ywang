As a leader, one must sometimes take actions that are unpopular, or whose results will not be known for years to come.

Although I am a gregarious person, I love solitude even more.

I learned that to humiliate another person is to make him suffer an unnecessarily cruel fate. Even as a boy, I defeated my opponents without dishonoring them.

Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.

Once a person is determined to help themselves, there is nothing that can stop them.

Courage is not the absence of fear â€” it is inspiring others to move beyond it.

Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.

It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.

Resentment is a method of self-harm.
