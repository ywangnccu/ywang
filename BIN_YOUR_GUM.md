BIN YOUR GUM


Discarding chewing gum on public streets is generally prohibited and might receive fines or other penalties depending on local regulations.

Beyond the potential legal ramifications, throwing chewing gum on the public roads has several negative consequences.

The chewing gum thrown around can easily get stuck to pedestrians, causing a lot of trouble for others.

Most chewing gum contains synthetic plastics and polymers, making it non-biodegradable. It can persist in the place for years, eventually breaking down into micro-plastics that can contaminate soil and water sources.

Discarded gum is an unsightly mess that detracts from the cleanliness and appeal of public spaces.

Removing gum litter is a labor-intensive and expensive process. The costs often passed on to tax givers and residents.

Chewed gum harbors oral bacteria and, if discarded, could potentially contribute to the spread of germs. Also, animals might mistake gum for food, potentially causing harm.

Responsible disposal of chewing gum

Wrap used gum in its original wrapper, a tissue, or another small piece of paper.

Dispose of the wrapped gum in a garbage bin or other designated receptacle.

By properly disposing of your chewing gum, you can help keep our streets clean, protect our living place, and reduce cleaners’ work load and decrease the financial burden of cleanup efforts.

Traditional gum alternatives

Consider changing to biodegradable gum options made from natural ingredients like chicle or plant-based polymers that decompose more readily.
