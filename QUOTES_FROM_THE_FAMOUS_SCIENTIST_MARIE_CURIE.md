I am among those who think that science has great beauty.

Scientists believe in things, not in person.

You must never be fearful of what you are doing when it is right.

Never to let one’s self be beaten down by persons or by events.

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.

One never notices what has been done. One can only see what remains to be done.

We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.
