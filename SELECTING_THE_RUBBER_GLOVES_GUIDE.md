Choosing the right rubber gloves, consider the material, size, and intended use. Nitrile gloves are often preferred for their durability and chemical resistance, 
while latex gloves offer better dexterity. Ensure a snug, comfortable fit, and no potential allergies.



Task and Application

Chemical procedures and medical settings

For working with chemicals, prioritize nitrile or butyl rubber gloves, known for their chemical resistance. Nitrile gloves are safe for medical settings, offering chemical and pathogen protection.

Cooking

Choose food-safe nitrile gloves, ensuring they meet relevant regulations.

General cleaning and household tasks

Vinyl gloves may suffice for lighter tasks, while thicker nitrile gloves are recommended for stronger cleaning agents.

 

Size and Fit

Measure your hand

Use a measuring tape to determine the circumference of your dominant hand, excluding the thumb. Refer to size charts provided by glove manufacturers.

Snug fit

Gloves should fit snugly. However, it should not restrict movement. A good fit allows for dexterity and prevents slippage.

Consider material stretch

Latex and nitrile gloves offer more stretch than vinyl, allowing for a more comfortable fit, even if you're between sizes. If in doubt, opt for the larger size, especially with nitrile.

 

Other Considerations

Thickness

Gloves come in varying thicknesses. Thicker gloves offer more protection. However, it can reduce dexterity. Choose based on the level of protection needed for the task.

Texture

Textured gloves can improve grip, especially when working with Slippery materials.

Cuff length

Longer cuffs offer more wrist and forearm protection.

 

Please pay attention to the expiration date of gloves, as their protective properties can degrade over time.
