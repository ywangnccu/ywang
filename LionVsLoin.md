Lion

Powerful apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). Lions prefer to live in a grassland, savanna, scrub and woodland. They are under strict protection.

 
Loin

The lower part of the back is located to the side between the lower ribs and the pelvis. 
The term is used to describe the anatomy of humans and quadrupeds such as horses, pigs, or cows. 
Anatomical references also apply to specific cuts of meat, including pork loin, beef tenderloin, sirloin or loin steak.
