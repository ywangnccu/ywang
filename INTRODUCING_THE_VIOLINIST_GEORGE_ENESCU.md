At the age of 3, he had one of those decisive musical experiences when he heard, by accident and for the first time, some fiddlers playing near to his native village. 
Impressed by what he heard, the child tried to imitate the instruments of the folk music band the very next day - the violin was a thread sewn on a piece of wood.

After he won the first prize for violin at the Paris Conservatory, he began his career as a virtuoso violinist and became famous for his interpretations of Bach. He was also known as a conductor.

Violinist Ivry Gitlis thought about George Enescu as if he were from another planet, an alien, as if he’d descended upon Earth to bring an offering. He shied away from any kind of ostentation. 
His message was very clear so you didn’t have to know what that message was in words. For him, the violin was the music. He wouldn’t talk about up and down bows. However, he’d speak of the sun, mountains and the sky. 
He lived something with you. It was not telling you to do this or do that. It was much more effective. He often changed markings in the score when he wanted more or less expression. 
If you let yourself be led by the music, it will always bring you where you have to go – he was like that, and I probably got this from him. He was a great composer, one who, like Bartok, came out of the people, out of a folk tradition. 
He was infused with the music of his land. Because he was a creative artist, when he played, it was like he was composing the music. Towards the last years of his life his back was completely curved, like a hunchback. 
I don’t know how he managed to perform. Even hearing him perform at a Wigmore Hall recital in these years, the playing was very beautiful. He still sounded so young. His personality as an artist dominated his capacities, or incapacities. 
There are so many things going on that stop us from seeing properly. Everything is so available without us having time to distinguish what is worthwhile and what is not. What George taught me is not to take things as they are, or as they seem. 
However, go into them and look inside yourself. What is your response to the notes you’re seeing? George taught me how to read the music.

His chamber works included three violin sonatas. He’s a god among violinists thanks to his exhaustive output for the instrument and his dynamite tone.
