If you're looking for a deliciously simple dessert, look no further. This icebox cake combines graham crackers with a lemon-maple filling for a quick and easy treat. 
The best part is the filling is made with nonfat yogurt, so anyone can enjoy this dessert guilt-free.

Ingredients

3 Cups Nonfat Plain Yogurt

1 Tablespoon Maple Syrup

Half Teaspoon Grated Lemon Peel

Half Teaspoon Vanilla Extract

Half Teaspoon No-Calorie Sweetener

6 Full Sheets of Low-fat Whole-Grain Graham Crackers


Directions

Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving over wrap on the two long sides.

In a bowl, stir together the yogurt, maple syrup, lemon peel, vanilla, and sweetener.

Line 3 graham cracker halves in the loaf pan. Spread one-third of the yogurt mixture over the crackers. Repeat twice. Top with the remaining 3 graham cracker halves.

Using the extra plastic on the two long sides, wrap the cake and refrigerate it for about 3 hours. 

Unwrap the cake and using the overhanging plastic, pull the cake out of the pan. With a knife, gently cut the cake into 6 slices. Garnish with lemon peel and serve.
