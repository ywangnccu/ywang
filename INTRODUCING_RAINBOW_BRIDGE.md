INTRODUCING RAINBOW BRIDGE


![INTRODUCING RAINBOW BRIDGE](https://github.com/ywangnccu/ywang/blob/main/images/RAINBOW-BRIDGE-FALLS.jpg)

The Rainbow Bridge was built to replace the Falls View Bridge. The new bridge was constructed on top of 50 feet abutments. The 950 feet long bridge is on the border of Canada and the USA.

The origin of its name is lost, although the steel arc that supports the bridge offers one potential explanation. 
From Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side, the sight of a rainbow following the arc of the bridge is another explanation.

The bridge is available to passenger vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians from each side. People westbound from the United States to Canada are required to pay a toll.

Canadian and United States citizens who want to cross the Niagara River need a valid passport, enhanced driverâ€™s license, or Nexus card. The latter is available to those who frequently cross the border. 
Visitors from countries requiring a visa for visiting the USA or Canada must also have this ready to show.

If you have time, walk across the bridge in either direction for panoramic views of the American and Horseshoe falls. The river itself is also a great sight, with powerful currents indicating the awesome power of nature.

Many people have their photos taken with the Rainbow Bridge and falls. Please bring your passport and photo ID if you are planning to take the views from the other side of the bridge.
