Joseph Paul DiMaggio was an American professional baseball player who was an outstanding hitter and outfielder and one of the best players in the baseball game. 
He set the record for the longest hitting streak at 56 games in major league baseball. This record has not been broken so far. 
Star DiMaggio played for the Yankees for the entirety of his career, from 1936-1951. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

DiMaggio was the eighth of nine children born to Sicilian immigrants. His mother named him Giuseppe.

DiMaggio was a three-time American League MVP Award winner. During his tenure with the Yankees, he led the Yankees to nine titles of World Series championships. 
DiMaggio was the classic five-tool player. He stole 30 bases in his career regular season. He wasn’t affected by the pressure. 
Other team players think that the only way to get a hit against the Yankees was to hit the baseball where Joe wasn't.

“He came through like a real money player,” said Yankees manager Joe McCarthy after the game. “He lived up to my expectations. 
I’m certain Joe will be an important factor in our pennant drive. He’ll certainly take up a lot of slack in our club.”

The talented left-handed pitcher Gomez said, "I'm the guy that made Joe DiMaggio famous." He also thinks DiMaggio ran down so many of my mistakes.

DiMaggio insisted on being introduced as the "Greatest Living Ballplayer" at events. He once punched Billy Crystal for not introducing him as such.

The New York Times called DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak "perhaps the most enduring record in sports."

Yankee Stadium's fifth monument was dedicated to DiMaggio in 1999. Also on that date the West Side Highway was officially renamed in his honor. 
The Yankees wore DiMaggio's number 5 on the left sleeves of their uniforms for the 1999 season.

The place where DiMaggio first took up baseball as a boy was named as the Joe DiMaggio North Beach Playground. 
The United States Postal Service issued an image of DiMaggio appearing on a stamp as part of the Major League Baseball Star Stamp Series.
