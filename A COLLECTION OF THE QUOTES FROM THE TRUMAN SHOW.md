Truman is unaware that his entire life is a hugely popular TV series. 
In this real-time documentary, every moment of Truman's existence is captured by concealed cameras and telecast to a giant global audience. 
People around him are actors who smile pleasantly at Truman's familiar catchphrase greeting, 
"In case I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!" His whole life has been manufactured for public entertainment. 
Here’s a collection of some of the best quotes from the film.
