Ingredients

1 and 1/2 cup plain soy milk

3 cups raw cashews

9 strawberries

1/3 cup syrup

1/3 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions

Make sure your ice cream maker barrel is fully frozen.

Soak the cashews in hot water for at least a half hour. One - three hours is preferred for creaminess. However, it is not necessary.

Drain the cashews and add them to a high speed blender. Also add in the soy milk, syrup, vanilla and nine clean strawberries. Blend from low to high so it is silky smooth.

Assemble your ice cream maker and turn it on. Pour in the strawberry and cashew mixture. Allow to churn for about nine minutes.

Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-friendly container and chill for a half hour to slightly thicken - this is best for scooping, though you could just soft-serve it right away, straight from the ice cream maker. Enjoy!

Covered the leftover and put it in the freezer.
