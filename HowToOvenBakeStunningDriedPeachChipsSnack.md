PREPARE TIME - 15 minutes

COOK TIME - 3 hours

TOTAL TIME - 3 hours 15 minutes

Ingredients

3 Peaches, peeled if not organic

Parchment Paper

Instructions

Preheat oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Clean and dry peaches.  Slice in half and remove the pit.

Peel peaches if you prefer to not eat the peel or if they are not organic.

Slice peaches in 1/8 inch slices, reserve ends for another use.  
(Note - if you slice the peaches thicker, it will take longer for them to dry)

Place peach slices on parchment lined baking sheet, leaving space between each slice.

Bake at 200 degrees F for approximately 1 hours 50 minutes so the top of the peaches are dry.

Peel the peach slices from the parchment paper and flip over. 
Continue to bake for another 30 minutes to an hour so they are fully dehydrated.

Remove the dried peach slices from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Put in an airtight container at room temperature. 
The peach chips can be stockpiled for several months at room temperature without spoiling.
