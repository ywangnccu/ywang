Ingredients

    1 head of torn lettuce (or just one smaller bag of salad mix)

    1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

    1/3 cup diced pepper

    1 cup chopped celery

    1/3 cup chopped cabbage

    1 ripe diced avocado

    1/3 cup diced onion

    1 cup pecans

    1 pound cooked and crumbled loin steak

 

Dressing

    1 Cup mayonnaise

    1 Cup ranch salad dressing

    1 Tablespoon granulated sugar

    1 Tablespoon seasoning

    1/3 Tablespoon garlic powder

 

Instructions

Layer lettuce, onion, pepper, celery, cabbage and crumbled loin steak into a large baking pan.

In a bowl, stir together mayonnaise, sugar, seasoning and garlic powder. Spread over the top of the salad after the loin steak layer.

Top with the shredded cheddar cheese.

Cover the container with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 9 hours.

Remove from the fridge. Add avocado and pecans (that way they stay crunchy).

This is best enjoyed on the first day or else it starts to go soggy.
