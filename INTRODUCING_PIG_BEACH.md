Pig Beach is a magical tourist destination in the Bahamas, specifically located on Big Major Cay, an uninhabited island in the Exuma Cays. 
This location is famous for its colony of feral pigs that are known to swim in the ocean and bask under the sun. The pigs with small eyes are friendly and enjoy human company. 
Tourists can book boat tour trips from Exuma George Town or Nassau. Visitors can interact with the pigs. However, it’s crucial to follow safety tips.

Listen to guidance carefully.

Do not feed the pigs processed foods or anything else not approved.

Feed the pigs only approved foods provided by the tour operator.

Don’t chase the pigs.

Keep your distance and avoid trying to touch or hold onto the pigs.

Avoid loud noises or sudden movements.

Do not wave food above them.

Avoid turning your back while holding food.

Limit overfeeding pigs.

While those pigs are accustomed to human interaction, they are feral animals and can be unpredictable. It's important to approach them with caution. 
Some sources mention potential safety concerns, such as the possibility of getting bitten or contracting infections. The tour will be fun and quirky with the right approach.
