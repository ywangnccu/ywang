Ingredients

Large White Chocolate Melting Chips, Regular Chocolate Chips, Ice Cream, Cones

Instructions

First, preheat the oven to 360 degrees.

Start by making chocolate monster eyes. Place the large white melting chips onto a baking pan lined with parchment paper. 
They don't need a lot of extra space. However, they do need a little bit of breathing room around each chip for melting purposes.

Set one regular chocolate chip on each of the white melting chips.

Place them in the preheated oven. Let the chocolates melt together for about 5 minutes. The chips will get a little bit gooey. Don't overcook the chocolate.

When the eyes are melty soft, take the pan out of the oven and put it into the refrigerator for about half of an hour. Once it is cool, the chocolate monster eyes will easily pop off of the parchment paper.

You could find some fun bright ice cream while shopping. There were several options to choose from in the monster colors.

Scoop the ice cream into a cone.

Add one or several chocolate monster eyes to the ice cream.

You could add the yummy monster eyes to any regular ice cream to make them Monster Ice Cream Cones. Let your kids help with the decorating to add to the fun!
