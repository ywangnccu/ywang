NINE ITEMS YOU SHOULD BUY AT THE THRIFT STORE

Thrift stores are the ultimate in sustainability—they are a way to reuse and repurpose someone’s cast-offs and save them from the landfill. However, thrifting is also undeniably fun. 
It’s a treasure hunt for grown-ups where you can find rare and useful items that will make your place unique and personality-filled, allowing your decor to stand apart from the pack.

"I’m the kind of person who doesn't even go to a regular store; I just go to thrift stores," says the owner of Urban Redeux. "You can pick up so much stuff, and almost anything you need you can buy at a thrift store." 
He typically sources punch bowls, barware, crystal, champagne flutes, and more from thrift stores.

Thrift stores can also be overwhelming, so it’s often helpful to have a strategy when you step through the front door. We spoke to a group of in-the-know experts—vintage shop owners and thrift-obsessed interior designers across the country—who shared their best tips for what to hunt for the next time you do a thrift run.

Classic Games

Before video games, classic games like Clue kept people entertained. If you come across a pile of vintage or rare board games in relatively good condition, they might be worth more than you think. 
Before you purchase, ensure every piece is intact. Games to look for include forgotten Milton Bradley titles. For example, Dark Tower.

Antique Furniture

The history of antique furniture is usually told through the material and designs. If you come across pieces that are older than your grandparents, it might be worth adding them to your collection.

“The most valuable pieces of antique furniture are those produced between the 16th and 19th century, including the Renaissance and Victorian furniture, 
for example. Pieces made during these times are highly prized for their intricate designs, rare materials and historical significance. Older furniture is a treasured form of decorative art and can provide a look into the history and culture of different time,” says Charman.

Silver

Silver-plated champagne buckets, trophy urns, and wine bowls that can be filled with collections or ornaments are superbly multipurpose. "I think they're fun, and the patina is really beautiful," says the owner of Urban Redeux. "You don’t get that character from a newer piece."

Discontinued Toys

If discontinued toys have a hard surface that can be bleached.  Or vintage toys that can be cleaned. However, they won’t be played with by kids. 
If you regret tossing your old Transformers action figures and toy cars, don’t worry. Redeem yourself the next time you visit the thrift store.

“A nostalgic reminder of childhood and simpler times, vintage toys are worth owning and keeping hold of, as they only increase in value — especially if they’re in good working condition. 
However, not every toy will be worth money, and it’s worth noting that there are certain factors that determine the value of an item, 
including its rarity, age, condition and historical significance. With toys specifically, limited-edition items and popular film merchandise also help increase a toy’s value,” suggests Charman.

Cups or Mugs

As long as they don’t have chips or cracks these can be cleaned and even bleached before you use them.  Or place some plants in them!

Seasonal Decor

You can find lots of seasonal decor at thrift stores.  Sometimes people get it so cheap.  They buy it before the season and then donate it after!

Pottery

Jennifer Sams, the owner of the mid-century modern vintage store City Issue, enjoys hunting for signed vintage pottery. 
She has occasionally unearthed treasures like a piece from Kentucky potter Charles Counts, whose pottery is collected by museums.

"It doesn't matter if I know who made a piece of pottery, if I can tell it was thrown on the wheel, and it has a signature, that to me is what I am glad about." Sams says. 
She enjoys doing a little detective work and trying to find out something about the maker when she purchases a unique piece of pottery.

However, you don't have to seek out just signed pieces—there is plenty of anonymous pottery worthy of purchasing.

Artwork

You can find drawings, prints, and a host of other original works of art at thrift stores, says Leah Ashley, an interior stylist and vintage expert. "It’s a wonderful way to set yourself apart and add these great conversation starters," 
she says. Ashley also likes to research the artist to find out the background behind a work of art.

Cast Iron

This seems to be getting harder to find.  At least in our area.  However, there’s nothing like cooking with cast iron.  And most of it can be cleaned if you’re willing to put in a little elbow grease!
