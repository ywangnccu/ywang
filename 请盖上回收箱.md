Friends/Neighbors,

Greetings! We often observed the above situation since last year. The recycling truck driver didn't cover the recycle bin after pouring those valuable recycling materials. 
Sometimes rain and snow accumulated in the bins. Small animals and insects go in and out of the recycling bins that causes the increase of mosquitoes and bugs, poor sanitation in our neighborhood, and reduced our resistance to diseases. 
In the long term it will affect our housing prices in the future. Perhaps some people think it is difficult for the recycling truck driver to cover recycling bins. However, this is not the case. When I shared my suggestion with this driver the first time, 
he covered every recycling bin within my sight. Then he didn't cover every recycling bin after the recycling truck was out of my sight! When I covered these recycling bins, I saw mosquitoes and insects flying around the bins. Therefore, 
I dialed the phone number on the recycling bin to report this situation. I appreciate the Town Hall governors, staff and the recycling truck driver's superiors. The driver covered the recycling bins for the next two consecutive weeks. However, the good situation did not last longer. 
Currently, the recycling truck driver dropped his work qualities to the previous unsatisfied status.

For taking good care of our residents and the sanitation of our living area, we need to call the phone number on the blue recycling bin to speak out our most basic demands together, and make sure our voices are heard. We hope the Town Hall will value the demands of tax givers. 
We hope the boss and supervisors of the recycling company will train the drivers and urge them to improve the work qualities. We are grateful to the green bin drivers for their awesome job! They covered every green bin each time! God bless everyone with peace and joy! Thank you!

朋友们和邻居们，

希望您们一切安好！自去年以来，我们常看到以上状况，回收车司机在收取有价值的回收物资后，故意让回收箱盖开着，任由雨雪沉积箱内，还有小动物和虫在回收箱里进出，所有这些导致蚊蝇滋生、居住地卫生状况变差、居民们对疾病抵抗力下降，长久以后一定影响房价。
或许有些人以为，回收车司机很难盖上回收箱，可事实不是如此。当我第一次和这司机分享建议时，在我视线范围内，他盖上了每一个回收箱，当回收车离开我视线以后，他让每一个回收箱盖开着！我盖上这些回收箱时，看见蚊蝇在箱内外飞来绕去。所以，我按回收箱上的电话号码反映了这状况，
感谢市政府工作人员和回收车司机的上级领导，接下来连续二周，司机盖上了回收箱。可好景不长，目前回收车司机的工作质量又下降到从前不尽如人意状况。

为了居住地的卫生与居民们自身安康，我们需按回收箱上的电话号码拨电话共同发声，反映我们的最基本要求，请市政府重视纳税人的需求，请回收公司老板和上司督促司机改善此事，
让回收车司机接受培训后才能上岗。在此，我们感谢绿箱司机们的勤恳优异工作！他们每次都盖上了所有绿箱！愿神祝福所有人平安喜乐蒙福！谢谢！
