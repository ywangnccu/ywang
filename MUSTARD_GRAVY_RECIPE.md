(I appreciate Hostinger AI for generating the image.)

Ingredients

Six tablespoons vegetable or canola oil

Half cup regular flour

One quart broth

One large shallot, finely chopped

Quarter cup prepared mustard, preferably Colmanâ€™s

Half teaspoon Pepper

Salt

Half teaspoon ground turmeric

Half cup Villa Borghetti Pinot Grigio

 

Directions

Combine the oil and shallot in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally for a few minutes.

Add the flour and cook, whisking often, about 3 minutes

Add the broth and grigio, a small splash at a time, thoroughly whisking after each addition to ensure there are no lumps. 
Once half the broth has been carefully incorporated, add the remaining broth and the turmeric and simmer, whisking occasionally, about 6 minutes.

Remove from heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Whisk in mustard then taste, adding more salt as needed to ensure the mustard flavor comes through. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer and serve.
