Streamline design is one among different types of designs. It has been known by people from ancient times.

The streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance.

The term is applied to railway train sets. Less commonly, the term is applied to fully fair upright and recumbent bicycles. 
As part of the Streamline Modern trend, the term was applied to passenger cars, trucks, and other types of light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicles. However, now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic.
