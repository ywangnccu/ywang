SOMEONE IS SPYING ME. PLEASE SHARE WITH ME HOW TO PREVENT PEEPING. I WILL NOT DELETE THIS MESSAGE UNTIL LEARNING THE TRUTH. 

各位朋友们大家好！
我确知有人在偷听、偷窥和偷摄我正常言行隐私，
恳请好心人将偷看我那网址告知我(ywang@nccu.edu)，定将酬谢您千元美金，
若有智慧善良人能与我分享正确提防被偷窥方法，将另外酬谢您千元美金，
希望您们帮助我和女儿及家人回归平静生活！
感谢！我相信正义可能迟到，可不会缺席！
我此生所做后悔一生之事，为去怜悯一个忘恩负义小人，
往年我设尽一切方法，希望落难才子振作起来，
如今，他利用一切可能机会落井下石，想尽所有心机拿钱砸人，只为了害我身败名裂。

Hi friends! 
I am sure that someone is still eavesdropping, peeping, and taking pictures of my normal private actions. 
I hope if kind-hearted people could share me the website that they are spying me. 
I will greatly appreciate and definitely reward you with a thousand dollars. 
If there is a wise person can share with me the correct way to beware of being peeped. I would like to reward you for another thousand dollars. 
Hoping you can help my daughter and my family return to a peaceful life! 
Thank you so much for your sharing and support! I believe JUSTICE delayed but not denied!
My only regretful thing in this life is feel compassion on an ungrateful villain. 
In the past years, we tried many methods to cheer up a gifted person in depression.
Now he is using every possible opportunity to push me into the trap, using every of his scheming to smash me with money, just to ruin my reputation.
