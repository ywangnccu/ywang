Bleach - Brave Souls is a free downloadable video game developed and published by KLabGames.

The game is a real-time, beat up action game with role-playing elements, featuring modes such as story and coop (PvE) and PVP. 
The game is free with options to purchase in-game items to increase one's progress.

It features hundreds of collectible characters who can be leveled up and used in combat. Bleach series creator has designed images for several unique character versions for the game, 
including ones related to the official spinoff sequel Can't Fear Your Own World. This story is serialized in the game.

The game received relatively positive reviews. Digitally Downloaded concluded that Brave Souls isn't the finest anime game out there. 
However, I believe it can be. Even in its bumpy, jagged state, KLab has managed to boil the franchise down to its most appealing elements and turn an intimidating multi-hundred chapter mess into something newcomers can actually parse.
