Ingredients

90 miniature marshmallows

3 chocolate candy bar, broken into 30 squares pieces

2 packages graham crackers, crushed

1/3 cup cooking oil



Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put baking paper cups in the 30 miniature muffin tins.

Mix graham cracker crumbs with cooking oil in a bowl, evenly combined. Spoon graham cracker mixture into the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the bottom and up the sides to create a crust.

Place 1 chocolate square piece onto each crust and top each with 3 miniature marshmallows.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 6 minutes so marshmallows are puffy and chocolate is melted.
