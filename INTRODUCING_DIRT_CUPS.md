Instructions

Chocolate pudding instructions

Combine the cornstarch, cocoa, granulated sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan and whisk them. Place the pan over medium high heat and gradually add the half and half while whisking constantly.

Cook while whisking constantly. The mixture will begin to thicken. Bring the mixture to a bubble and cook for about half to one minute, whisking constantly.

Remove from the heat source and add the oil and vanilla extract. Mix them to combine.

Spoon pudding evenly into the 6 dessert cups.

Dirt topping instructions

Combine the crumbs and oil in a small bowl. Mix them to combine.

Top each pudding cup with spoonsful of the crumbs. Refrigerate them while you make the strawberry carrots.

Strawberry carrots instructions

Skewer each strawberry through the top. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

Melt the candy in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave at full power in half minute intervals. Stir well between heating times, the candy will be melted and smooth. About one and a half minutes.

Dip strawberries into the melted candy up to the greens. Allow the excess candy to drip back into the bowl. Transfer back to the parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining strawberries. Allow the candy to set, about 15 minutes.

Place the leftover melted candy in a disposable piping bag and snip a tiny hole in the end. Drizzle melted candy over the strawberries in zigzag fashion to mimic the appearance of the carrotâ€™s textured lines. Allow the candy to set, about 15 minutes.

Place a strawberry carrot on top of each pudding cup. Refrigerate it in the refrigerator for up to 60 hours. Serve with mini shovel dessert spoons for a fun presentation.
