To select the check pattern

    The checked suit is a versatile and stylish addition to any man. However, pulling it off with flair requires some know-how. 
    Whether you're dressing for a formal event, a business meeting, or a casual outing, here's a comprehensive guideline on how to wear a checked suit in various settings.

    The first step in wearing a checked suit is choosing the right pattern. The size and style of the checks can significantly impact your look. Larger checks tend to make a more striking statement, while smaller, 
    subtler checks offer a more conservative appearance. Consider your personal style and the occasion when selecting the pattern.

    When choosing a check pattern, keep in mind the size of the checks and your body type. Larger checks can add visual weight, while smaller checks can create a slimming effect.

To choose the suit color

    Checked suits come in a variety of colors. When deciding on the suit color, think about the season, the formality of the event, and your skin tone.

    Darker checked suits are typically more formal and versatile. They are suitable for business meetings and formal events. These colors exude professionalism. Lighter colors are great for summer. 
    They create a lighter, more relaxed look that's perfect for casual outings.

    Lighter checked suits can make a fashion statement. They are ideal for creative, casual settings and events where you want to stand out.

    Consider your skin tone when choosing the suit color. Darker skin tones tend to work with a broader range of colors, while lighter skin tones may find that certain colors complement their complexion better.

To find the right shirt

    Selecting the right shirt and tie to match your checked suit is crucial. The solid-colored shirt is a safe choice that complements most check patterns. Pure white, light blue, or pastel shirts work well. 
    These colors create a clean, polished look and allow the focus to remain on your suit.

    For a subtle contrast, consider a shirt in a shade that matches one of the colors in the check pattern. This can add credit to your outfit without overwhelming it.

To combine with the tie

    When it comes to ties, choose a tie with a pattern that complements. However, it doesn't overpower the suit's check pattern. 
    A plain silk tie or a subtle pattern like stripes is a good option. The key is to strike a balance between the complexity of the tie pattern and the suit's checks.

To match footwear

    Your choice of shoes can make or break the look of your checked suit. For formal occasions or business settings, opt for leather oxfords or derbies, depending on the suit's color. 
    These shoe styles are timeless and match with the sophistication of a checked suit.

    In more casual settings, you can experiment with loafers or even clean, minimal sneakers for creating a stylish and comfortable appearance.

    The key is to choose footwear that complements the formality and color of your suit, as well as the occasion.

To add a pocket squares

     A pocket square that complements your suit or tie can be a subtle addition.  It can add a touch of sophistication to your checked suit. 
     A good pocket square can bring together the elements of your outfit and add a special individuality.

    Avoid overdoing it with a flashy pocket square, as the check pattern is already a statement in itself. Please focus on minimalistic and complementary choices that enhance the look. 
    Remember that a pocket square should enhance your style, not overwhelm it.

To tailor a comfortable suit jacket

    The fit of your suit is crucial for a polished look. Your suit jacket should cover your rear and sit flat on your back. Make sure it isn't puckering or pulling. 
    Ensure that your checked suit is tailored to fit your body perfectly. Make sure you can move comfortably in your jacket and that your arms have a range of motion. 
    The trousers should have the right length and sit on your waist. The jacket’s shoulders should fit your shoulders rather than squeeze very tightly or, alternatively, stick out. 
    A fitted suit enhances your appearance and exudes confidence.

    When purchasing a checked suit, keep in mind that alterations might be necessary. Off-the-rack suits may not provide a perfect fit. 
    However, a good tailor can make the necessary adjustments to ensure that your suit fits your body.

To choose an appropriate pants

    Please don’t overlook the pants. Suit pants wear differently than casual trousers. You want to wear these around your natural waist, not lower. Follow this suit advice for trying on pants.

    Suit pants should almost always have cuffs. The only exception is on short men; forgoing cuffs can help add the illusion of height. Otherwise, have your tailor add cuffs.

    Go with a slight break. The break refers to the crease formed where the pants hit the top of the shoe, so make sure you’re wearing the shoes you’ll wear with the suit when you get fitted for the break. 
    A medium break will bring the back of the pant leg about halfway down the heel of your shoe while a slight break brings the pant a little higher.

    Suit pants should sit at the waist. There is no such thing as low-rise suit pants.

To consider the occasion and style

    Consider the occasion when wearing your checked suit. For formal events, choose a conservative combinations and opt for darker suit. 
    In a business setting, choose a fitted glen plaid, paired with a crisp white shirt and a conservative tie. This ensemble communicates professionalism and attention to detail.

    In more relaxed settings, you can experiment with lighter colors and patterned accessories. For a casual outing, consider a more relaxed look suit with a light-colored shirt and a knit tie or a pocket square. 
    This look exudes a laid-back or stylish vibe.

    The key is to balance the check pattern with the formality of the event. Don't be afraid to express your personality through your outfit. However, please always keep the context in mind.

Conclusion

    In conclusion, a checked suit can be a versatile and stylish addition to you. By selecting the right pattern, color, and accessories, and ensuring a perfect fit, you can confidently wear a checked suit for various occasions. 
    Remember, it's not just about the suit you wear. It is also about how you wear it that makes a difference.

    So, use the check pattern, express your unique style, and make a fashion statement. Whether it's a formal event, a business meeting, or a casual outing, the checked suit offers endless possibilities for creating a fashionable and memorable look.
