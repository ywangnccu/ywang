    Tired of having your mailbox crammed with many mails you didn’t ask for? The good news is that there are ways to reduce how much unsolicited mail you get.

How To Get Less Mails From Marketers

    In order to decide what types of mail you do and don’t want from marketers, register at the Direct Marketing Association’s (DMA) consumer website DMAchoice.org, and choose what catalogs, magazine offers, and other mail you want to get. DMAchoice will stop most promotional mails. You’ll have to pay a $4 processing fee, and your registration will last for 10 years.

    Or, you can register by sending your name and address (with signature), along with a $5 processing fee to DMAchoice.

    The site also offers the no-cost option to stop mail from being sent to someone who’s deceased (Deceased Do Not Contact List) 
    or to a dependent in your care (Do Not Contact for Caretakers List). Registration for the Caretakers List will last for 10 years.

    DMAchoice.org also has an Email Preference Service that lets you get less unsolicited commercial email. There is no cost for registration. 
    The registration will last for six years.

How To Stop Credit Card and Insurance Offers

    If you don't want to get prescreened offers of credit and insurance in the mail, you have two choices for opting out of those offers.

Opting out of getting them for five years

    Go to optoutprescreen.com or call 1-888-5-OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688). The phone number and website are operated by the major credit bureaus.

Opting out of getting them permanently

    Go to optoutprescreen.com or call 1-888-5-OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688) to start the process. 
    However, in order to complete your request, you’ll need to sign and return the Permanent Opt-Out Election form you’ll get after you’ve started the process.

    When you call or visit optoutprescreen.com, they’ll ask for your personal information, including your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. 
    Sharing your Social Security number and date of birth is optional. However, the website says that giving this information can help them ensure that they can successfully process your request. 
    It says the information you give is confidential and will be used only to process your request to opt out.
