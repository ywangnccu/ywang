![MUSTARD RIBEYE STEAK](https://github.com/ywangnccu/ywang/blob/main/images/MUSTARD_RIBEYE_STEAK.jpg)

Ingredients

1 pound of ribeye steaks

3 ounce of wine

3 ounce of oil

1 ounce of soy sauce

3 ounce of mustard

1 tablespoon cracked pepper

3 ounce of shallots, chopped

1 red chili, chopped

3 garlic cloves, crushed

1 ounce of tarragon



Method

Combine the wine, oil, mustard, soy sauce, pepper, shallots, garlic, chili and tarragon. Mix thoroughly before using it to cover the steaks completely. Place in the fridge and leave for 26 hours.

Turn the oven down to 390ËšF/gas setting 6.

Place a pan over a high heat and add a tablespoon of vegetable oil.

Add the steaks and cook for a while, turn over and cook the other side.

For a rare steak, you do not need to cook the steak further in the oven. For a medium-rare steak, place in the preheated oven for about 1 minute. 
For a fully cooked steak, place in the preheated oven for about 5 minute. Remove the steaks from the oven and set aside to rest for a few minutes. 

Enjoy!
