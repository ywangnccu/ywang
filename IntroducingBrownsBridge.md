The Browns Bridge was a cantilever bridge in Georgia that carried Browns Bridge Road across the Chattahoochee River / Lake Sidney Lanier between Gainesville and Cumming.

According to HistoricBridges.org, the Browns Bridge has the appearance of cantilever trusses, however closer inspection reveals rigid connections with no hinges. 
It is found with true cantilever trusses. A number of large bridges were built in this area to accommodate the construction of Buford Dam in 1956.
The combined length of just the truss spans of this bridge is over thousand feet. 
The full continuous and cantilever truss bridges are extremely rare in Georgia and so while this bridge is not an early example of its type in the US, it has a high level of local and state significance as a rare example of its kind. 
Moreover, continuous trusses are uncommon in America.
