There are no longer any safe places out of the view of spy cameras (hidden cameras) for women. 
There are spy cameras in many public spaces, such as public restrooms, changing rooms, hotels, and transportation stations to satisfy the desire of crazy voyeurs without the subject’s consent and knowledge. 
Spy cameras are tiny, easily concealed, and come in different forms including disguised as an ordinary household item such as the calculator, clothing hook, or coffee cup, even hidden in people's houses. 
They are inexpensive and can operate for extended periods on a battery.

Once a non-consensual image or movie has been shared once, the victim simply fears it might be shared, the fear of the image appearing or reappearing shroud the survivor indefinitely.

Succeeding in having the photos or movies removed from specific websites provides no sense of security, 
as anyone who has ever viewed them even for a second could print a screen or record it and can share that image/movie any time. 
Any anonymous viewers can save, upload, and distribute the screen images on any site.

People across the globe have been impacted by this crime. They usually do not know who or how someone got a hold of their private photos and videos.

One victim said, "Finding out I’ve been a victim of revenge porn has happened to me so many times the initial emotions of hurt, fear, anxiety and panic have boiled down over time to just rage. 
At the start, I fell into states of isolation to try and protect myself, and even went so far as to change my name. 
The idea that a minute upload for one person can be years or a life of torment for another is devastating."
