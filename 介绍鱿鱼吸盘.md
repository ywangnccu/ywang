The suckers of squid come in many shapes and sizes. Some suckers look and act like a suction cup, while others have evolved into hooks that dig into prey. Giant Squid has sharp hooks on arms, next to each sucker cup. 
They are made entirely of proteins. Usually everything that is hard in biological organisms requires the presence of minerals. However, the squid suckers do not, making them an entirely unique phenomenon.
