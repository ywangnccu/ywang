INGREDIENTS

Half Pound Ground Chuck Beef

1 Tsp Salt

Quarter Tsp Pepper

Half Avocados

Pickles

Lettuce

1 Slices Cheese

1 Burger breads

 

INSTRUCTIONS

Slice the avocado.

Get your grill/pan hot.

Salt and pepper the ground beef. Make into patties that are about 1/2 inch larger than the burger breads.

Put a thumbprint in the middle of the patty so it doesnâ€™t puff up when cooking.

Grill your burgers for a few minutes on the first side.

Flip burgers and add cheese after a couple minutes. Put the bread face down on the grill. Cook for about 3 minutes.

Stack up the ingredients and enjoy!
