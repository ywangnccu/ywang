The principles of Montessori education were developed by Doctor Maria Montessori over many years of experimentation and observation. They are based on respect for students’ learning process. 
From the beginning, Doctor Montessori based her work on her observations of kids and experimentation with the learning space, materials, and lessons available to them. She opened her first classroom, the Casa dei Bambini in a tenement building. 
The classroom was established to serve underprivileged kids who many thought were unable to learn. She frequently referred to her work as scientific pedagogy. 
Montessori education is based on a model of human development. The Montessori Theory is an educational approach that emphasizes individualized instruction and self-paced learning.

Respect student

This involves respecting the uniqueness of every kid - their choice of their own work, their interests, their movement, correction of their own mistakes, and their own work pace. Montessori educators work and interact with children from a place of genuine respect.

Individualized learning

Montessori learning programs are personalized to each child based on their unique stage of development, interests, and needs. 
Lessons with the Montessori materials are presented one-on-one based on each student’s academic progress. Educators track each kid’s progress and support them as they progress through the curriculum.

The absorbent mind and the Sensitive stages

Doctor Maria Montessori’s research determined that the first six years of life are the most crucial in a kid’s development. She termed it the stage of the absorbent mind to describe the kid’s sponge-like capacity to absorb information from their learning space. 
During this time, kids rapidly develop an understanding of their culture, and their world, and construct the foundations of their intelligence and personality. 
Doctor Maria Montessori also observed that students go through specific stages in their development when they are most capable of learning specific knowledge areas and abilities. She described these stages are windows of opportunity for learning. 
Characteristics of sensitive periods include intense focus, repetition, commitment to a task, and greatly extended time of concentration.

Independence

Montessori is an education for independence. It provides students with the classrooms, materials, and guidance to learn to do and think for themselves. 
It views kids as born learners who are capable and willing to teach themselves when provided with the right stimulus. The ultimate goal of Montessori education is independence.

Auto education and intrinsic motivation

One of the core principles of the Montessori Method is the concept of auto-education. It’s based on the belief that students are capable and willing to teach themselves if they are provided with interesting learning stimuli. 
Montessori materials were developed to meet this need and empower kids with the ability to direct their own education. Montessori educators provide the prepared learning space, guidance, and the encouragement for students to educate themselves. 
The Montessori approach takes the view that learning is its own reward. In the Montessori classroom there aren't any rewards for students’ learning. They derive a sense of accomplishment from completing an activity and learning to do it for themselves.

Educating the whole kid with every aspect

Montessori education is focused on nurturing each kid’s potential by providing learning experiences that support their intellectual, physical, emotional and social development. In addition to language and mathematics, 
the Montessori Curriculum also covers practical life, sensorial, and culture. Every aspect of kids’ development and learning are intertwined and viewed as equally important.

Prepared classroom

The Montessori classroom is a carefully prepared learning space where everything has a purpose and a place. There is a distinct sense of order that assists kids in developing logical thought processes. 
Within this learning space, students follow their interests, choose their work, and progress at their own pace.
