The natural South Beach in Georgia is a must-visit destination for those seeking an enjoyable beach time.


The South Beach is a picturesque stretch of coastline. This beach is perfect for basking in the sun, swimming and building sandcastles, making it an ideal place for both adults and kids.



The South Beach is considered the downtown district of the island and is loaded with shops, restaurants, bars and attractions for the entire crew.



Sand is more a crushed shell than soft sand.



If you need to cool off from an afternoon in the sun, South Beach is the perfect place to enjoy a drink. Known for their variety of chilli alcoholic slushies, the bars also offer icy alcohol-free cocktails in every flavor. Mix and match their flavors to make your very own frozen drink!



The South beach in Georgia is very clean with convenient paid parking.



In South Beach, you'll find the island's local restaurants and shopping, every within walking distance.



Make sure to take some time to stroll downtown for amazing island shopping. Forget some beach essentials? No problem! The beach stores have you covered. Once you’ve gathered your goods, head out on one of Boo's Bikes for an afternoon of exploring. These electric bikes take the hard work out of cycling and make for an afternoon everyone can enjoy!



What better way to celebrate a good moment at the south beach? These beach favorites serve up fantastic food with a side of lively entertainment. Hop on stage and spend the time singing to your favorite tunes. For those looking for a variety of games, every neon sign directs to Rock House. Here, guests are invited to play darts if they're shy to get the mic for karaoke.
