The Okefenokee Swamp is a shallow swamp in Georgia. It is the largest swamp in North America. The habitats within the Okefenokee Swamp are diverse and include sandy ridges, grassy savannas, cypress swamps, 
meandering canoe trails, small islands, and extensive prairies among many others. There are lots of floating mats of peat, or tree islands that provide a unique habitat for many shrubs and trees. 

These habitats allow for the existence of extremely high levels of biodiversity within the swamp. 
This includes at least 600 types of plants like the giant tupelo and moss as well as abundant fauna including over 400 animal species.

During the Cretaceous period, the Okefenokee swamp was under the ocean. The marine sediments left from this time means that there is a layer of sandy soil. 
More recently, wave activity created by offshore sand bars near the swamp presumably created the depression that is now the swamp. 

This massive area offers three entrance areas and encompasses a national park in GA. It was extremely quiet. There was no cell service. 
Being so far from inhabited areas made Stephen Foster Park a great place to observe the sky. We found that to be true and enjoyed seeing stars in this Dark Sky Park.

There are many canoe trails to explore. There is tremendous beauty in this unique place and lots to learn about the habitat. 
The park rented small boats and we took a boat tour with a very knowledgeable park ranger. We rented a punt. Then we rented a kayak. It was fun exploring by boat. However, it was a bit nerve-racking seeing so many alligators.
