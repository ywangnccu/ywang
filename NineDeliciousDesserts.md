INGREDIENTS

160 g cake flour

3 tablespoon matcha powder

¾ teaspoon baking powder

⅛ teaspoon sea salt

180 g granulated sugar

160 g butter at room temperature (unsalted)

135 g cream cheese (note 1)

3 large eggs at room temperature

 
Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 325 F

Soften cream cheese in the microwave. It should be at a spreadable consistency.

Sift together cake flour, matcha powder, baking powder and salt. Make sure leavening agent is evenly dispersed throughout dry mixture. Stir to incorporate. Set aside.

In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat sugar and room temperature butter together on medium speed so that it is fluffy.

Add softened cream cheese into mixture, beat on medium-low. Do not over beat.

Add room temperature eggs one at a time and beat on medium-low so that it looks smooth and creamy.

Pause mixer, add dry ingredients into the wet batter in 3 separate additions. 
Beat on the lowest setting. Almost every dry ingredient inside bowl are no longer visible.

Turn off mixer, take the bowl out and scrape down the sides, gently fold in the rest of the dry ingredients.

Transfer batter into a loaf pan lined with baking sheet.

Bang the pan on the counter several times to remove excess air.

Bake for 40-50 minutes. Insert a skewer. It should come out clean. The cake will look golden.

Let it cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.

Once cooled, keep cake at room temperature in an air tight container. Enjoy!

(If placing in the fridge, let it come back to room temperature about half an hour before serving.)

 

Matcha Strawberry Bars

![DESSERT](https://github.com/ywangnccu/ywang/blob/main/images/DESSERT/DESSERT19.jpg)

https://shorturl.at/hwBNO

INGREDIENTS

Matcha Crust

3/4 cup oil

2 ounce granulated sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

190 grams gluten-free flour

1 tablespoons matcha

 
Strawberry cream

60 grams cold water

2 1/4 tsp powdered gelatin (one standard packet)

2 cups heavy cream

1 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 tsp vanilla extract

1/4 tsp salt

3 tablespoons strawberry jam

Pink or red food dye (optional)

Topping

Strawberries, sliced thinly (optional)


INSTRUCTIONS

Matcha crust

Preheat oven to 325°F and line a 9 inch square baking tin with baking sheet, making sure it's pressed closely against the sides of the tin. 
The baking sheet should extend at least 1 inch up the sides of the tin.

In a medium bowl, use a stand mixer to cream together the butter and sugar so that it is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and mix them. 
Add 190 g gluten-free flour and matcha powder and mix on medium speed to form a cohesive dough.

Press the dough evenly onto the bottom of the tin, making sure to press against the sides of the tin so that there is no space between the baking sheet and the dough. 
I like to use a metal measuring cup to flatten the dough evenly.

Bake for about 19 minutes. It'll be soft and puffy when you take it from the oven and will solidify as it cools. 
Remove from the oven and place in the fridge to cool while you make the strawberry cream.


Strawberry cream

Place 60 g water in a bowl. Sprinkle the surface of the water with gelatin powder and leave to bloom.

In a medium pan, add heavy cream, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, and strawberry jam. 
Place on the stove over medium heat, stirring constantly so that the sugar and the jam have dissolved. 
This should take about 5 minutes. Do not let the cream come to a boil. Mix in a dab of pink or red food coloring to help create a more vivid pastel pink.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the gelatin so it dissolves. Let cool for 3 minutes.

Remove the matcha crust from the fridge. It should be firm to the touch. Gently and slowly pour the strawberry cream on top of the matcha crust. 
Carefully transfer the tin to the fridge and let set for 6 hours or longer.

Slice and serve

Once the snack bars are set, slice into 16 equal pieces. Put healthy sliced strawberries on top of the bar.
