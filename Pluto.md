Pluto is the ninth largest known object in the solar system. It is geologically rich. Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock. It has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon, and one-third its volume.

Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet. However, its planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. In 2006, 
the International Astronomical Union formally redefined the term planet to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.

Pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide.

The plains on Pluto's surface are most composed of nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. Sputnik Planitia is covered with churning nitrogen ice cells that are geologically young and turning over because of convection. 
Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto, whereas methane is most abundant near 300° east. The mountains are made of water ice.

Pluto's surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color. Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System.

We appreciate the New Horizons science team so we can see his face clearly. The team summarized initial findings as Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms, 
including those resulting from glaciological and surface–atmosphere interactions as well as impact, tectonic and possible cryovolcanic

In Western parts of Sputnik Planitia there are fields of transverse dunes formed by the winds blowing from the center of Sputnik Planitia in the direction of surrounding mountains.

Pluto means the god of the underworld, who has the ability to become invisible, and can be used to describe the remoteness of the new planet.
