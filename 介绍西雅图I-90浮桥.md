The Lacey Murrow Memorial Bridge is a floating bridge in the Seattle metropolitan area. It carries Interstate 90 from Seattle to Mercer Island. The proposed floating bridge was met with skepticism. 
Construction began on January 1, 1939 and was completed in 1940. The project spent approximately $9 million. 
The bridge sank in a storm in 1990 during refurbishment and repair. The cost of the disaster was $69 million. 
Thankfully, prior to the collapse, construction workers who were working on the bridge noticed it was starting to sink. A few workers were on the bridge when it was going down. 
However, there were no fatalities or injuries. The disaster delayed the bridge's reopening in 1993.
