Visiting the longest timber-towered suspension bridge - Boyne Mountain Resort’s SkyBridge Michigan if you hope a 360-degree bird’s-eye perspective you can't get anywhere else. It sways, it dips and it offers good views.

Boyne Resort’s speaker Ernst says there are big timber towers on sides of the valley, and it’s a suspension bridge — so you need to have an understanding that there’s going to be some movement. 
Sometimes it’s a gentle sway, sometimes more than that. You feel the aspect of the movement while you’re on it. Some people are fearful of strolling on a bridge suspended 36 meters above the ground. However, most folks are happy to try it.

SkyBridge Michigan fits with the resort’s goals — and its aesthetic — because its timber structure blends in with the landscape. 
Everywhere across SkyBridge Michigan offers perfect photo opportunities as nature's vibrant seasonal display surrounds you. It offers breathtaking panoramic views of the Boyne Valley and surrounding hills. Experience a journey with Michigan's natural charm.
