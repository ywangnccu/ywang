INGREDIENTS

Beef Top Loin - Three Pounds

Cracked Pepper - Half Teaspoon

Dried Seasoning - One And Half Teaspoon

Cloves Garlic - Three Minced

Oil - One Tablespoon


PREPARATION

Add the seasoning into the beef loin at least 6 hours before steam. Make sure to let it come to room temperature before cooking.

Preheat the steam oven in the Convection Mode 400 degrees

Place the meat on a small rack in a shallow pan and roast for about 16 minutes.

Change the oven cooking mode to Convection Steam 300 degrees and cook for about one hour so the roast reaches your preferred internal temperature.



Remember the internal temperature will rise about 9 degrees while the meat is resting.

Rare - 130 degrees

M/Rare - 140 degrees

Medium - 150 degrees

Allow a few minutes for resting prior to slicing the beef loin.
