Alcohol-Free Drinking Tips From Experts

You don’t need alcohol in your drink to make it feel special. Drinks can be just as fun without the hard stuff.

Sweet is not complete. Think about flavor additions other than sugar. 
Alex Pendergrass, who heads up the food and drinks at Hotel Viking’s One Bellevue, says, “Alcohol-free drinks can often tend to be very fruit-forward or syrupy when not properly done.”

Get creative. 
Mike Spence, the beverage director for several bars, including New Jersey’s Tommy’s Tavern + Tap and Tio Taco + Tequila Bar, says, 
“I believe in serving alcohol-free drinks that have a creative edge over what’s already been done over and over in the industry.”

You’ll notice that many of the alcohol-free drinks recipes include a garnish. 
Don’t forget the aesthetics of a great drink! Pendergrass says, “I enjoy a alcohol-free drink, that is well balanced in both taste and presentation.”

Don’t forget the bubbly. From splashes of kombucha to alcohol-free beer, there’s always a way to sneak in carbonation. 
Pendergrass says is “always a lot of fun, especially around the New Year.”

Ingredients

Thyme syrup
1 cup sugar
1 cup boiling water
4 sprigs thyme
Stir sugar and water together so that sugar is dissolved. Steep thyme in syrup so that it is infused.

Grilled peach syrup
1 cup sugar
1 cup boiling water
2 ripe peaches (sliced, then grilled to caramelized)
Stir sugar and water together so that sugar is dissolved. Transfer mixture to a blender, add peaches, and blend them to liquefied.

Final alcohol-free drink
6 ounces chilled chai tea
2 ounces grilled peach syrup (instructions above)
1 ounce thyme syrup (instructions above)
Sliced peach and thyme sprig, for garnish
Combine tea and both syrups, then garnish with peach and thyme sprig.

Instructions

Start with the thyme syrup. Mix boiling water and sugar so that the sugar is dissolved. 
Ta-da, you’ve just made simple syrup! Now, steep thyme in the syrup so that the flavors combine. 
That could be for as little as 30 minutes. However, the longer you let it infuse, the more powerful the flavor becomes.

Then make the grilled peach syrup. Slice the peaches and grill them so they are caramelized.
Make your simple syrup (see above) and blend it with the grilled peaches. Perfection!

Mix your chai with the syrups. Shake it up.

Finally, garnish and serve. Your peach alcohol-free drink is served.
